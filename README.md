# A prototype ticketing system
A simple SPA ticketing system. Everything has been designed to be as simple as possible. Passing JSON back and forth is not something
I preferred but seemed to mesh with with some of the other APIs I was using.

IntercoolerJS (inspired on Turbolinks) was initially used but created multiple issues during development.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- SQLAlchemy
- Passlib
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Admin
- Flask-Compress
- Flask-Mail
- Flask-Login

## Front-end Framework
- Semantic-UI

## Other Javascript Libraries
- jQuery
- jQuery Form
- DataTables
- DataTables Select (separated at the moment, but can be incorporated into the core DataTables JS file)
- DataTables for Semantic-UI
- Transparency

## TODO
1. Finish up the front-end.
2. Complete an administrator interface.
3. Many other items.
