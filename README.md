# A prototype ticketing system
A simple SPA ticketing system. Everything has been designed to be as simple as possible. Passing JSON back and forth is not something
I preferred but seemed to mesh well with some of the other APIs I was using.

IntercoolerJS (inspired by Turbolinks) was initially used but created multiple issues during development.
